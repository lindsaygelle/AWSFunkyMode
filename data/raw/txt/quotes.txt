        - "Unbelievable type of a situation! You've found all of the DK coins!"
        - "I'm sorry, Dixie/Kiddy/Kongs, I didn't think you'd actually find them all, so I've got nothing new to show you!"
        - "Hey, Dixie/Kiddy/Kongs, just kidding, you know? May I introduce you to my finest and coolest creation yet, the Funky-Copter!"
        - "Back again? Radical. This time you need to use the Turbo Ski to beat your opponents to the finish line. Do three laps of the track to complete the challenge!"
        - "Yo, dudes, you flew around that track. Here, take these."
        - "Well done, dudes! You have passed all my challenges."

        - "Right, dude, this is a tricky one. The timer will start very low. You must try to catch more than one same-colored fish at a time; the more on the hook, the greater the kombo. Once you get a kombo, you will gain more time. Fill the timer to complete the challenge." (introduction to the Chimp Caverns challenge, Let's Go a Kombo'in)
        - "Biggest kombo is [number]"
        - "Oh, dear! I think you had better try again."
        - "Well done, dude! Here, take this reward!"
        - "Bummer! I think you had better try again. I see you did manage to catch that pesky crab, though. Here, take this."
        - "Well done, dude! Cool fishing! And you caught that pesky crab! Here, take these as a reward!"
        - "Hey, dudes, tell Candy she can ride my wave anytime!"
        - "Looking good, Kongs! Belt up. Blast off. You're outta sight!"
        - "Yeah, Kongs! Like, jump in and, like, um, jet outta here!"
        - "Yo, Gorillas! Seek the Cranky one, the guru of game stuff!"
        - "Need some lives? Get on down to Jungle Hijinxs."
        - "Hey, man! Try my fishing challenge!"
        - "Dudeski, your bud has gotta be on a level somewhere!"
        - "Fancy a flight, DK? You know the score. Hop in and grab air!"'
        - "Lookin' good, Kongs! Belt up. Blast off. You're outta sight!"'
        - "Yo, Diddy! Lost the big guy again? Hop in and have a look!"
        - "Where's your pal? Try checking the jungle for your bud!"
        - "Fancy your chances! Try my fishing challenge!"
        - "Yeah, wicked, man!"
        - "I'm bailing out, dudes!"
    Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest:
        - "Woah! Dude, come in and join me. The waves are excellent."
        - "Wait 'til tomorrow, and we will all go."
        - "Lookin' good, dudes! I'm Funky the main monkey, and my new Funky's Flights can take you anywhere on Crocodile Isle, provided you're already checked it out, of course! Unfortunately, I'm overrun with business at the moment, so I'm far too bust to help you guys out. Don't worry, though. I'm sure we can come to some arrangement."
        - "I know! I will lend you one of my copters, but only if you can prove you can fly it."
        - "Cruise on over and jump in the barrel, man. Go ride the skies!"
        - "Right, dudes, listen up. This is how you fly. Use the  to steer the Gyrocopter."
        - "Pressing the  button will fire the main fun. Have you got all that?"
        - "This is a piece of cake. All you have to do is take off and fly through twenty rings. You can pass through each ring in any direction. Slowly land at the helipad to complete the mission. You have five minutes of fuel. Good luck!"
        - "Awesome, guys. You sure got the hang of flying."
        - "You are now free to use the copter whenever you need it. Just access your inventory by pressing START and choose Gyrocopter."
        - "One more thing. I could use a good pilot."
        - "Come back to see me. I have plenty of jobs on the go."
        - "Here, take this. Many thanks, guys."
        - "What happened, dudes? You bailed before the mission was completed. I think you need to try again."
        - "I think I'll catch some rays now!"
        - "Woah, dude, you back again? I have just the job for you, but you must learn to fly using advanced controls."
        - "Pressing the  button will lock your facing direction, allowing you to shoot while moving backwards. Pressing the  button will make the copter face forward; useful in tight situations. One thing, though. While in this mode, you can only drop bombs."
        - "I need you to take a chest to the second landing zone. There is one problem. The way ahead is flooded. The Gyrocopter can only hold so much air, so keep a close eye on the gauge in the bottom right corner of the screen. Press SELECT to release the winch; it will automatically hook onto the chest. Press SELECT again to retract the winch. One more thing. You'll need to pick up some ammo packs and blast your way through any blockages."
        - "This is a long-haul mission. I have filled her up to the max. You have ten minutes of flyin' time. Don't waste it."
        - "Not cool, dude!"
        - "Ouch!"
        - "Cool, dude!"
        - "Well done, guys. You did it. The chest is still in one piece."
        - "Thanks for your help. Take this Hero Coin."
        - "Back again? This mission is quite tricky."
        - "The Kremlings have destroyed the DK statue. Find the pieces and reconstruct it. To hook a statue piece, press SELECT to release the winch. Pressing SELECT again will drop off anything on the rope. One more thing. Keep a close eye on any statue pieces rebuilt, as they might go missing. You have five minutes of fuel, so get going."
        - "Wow! You sure know how to handle that old bird."
        - "Here is your reward."
        - "Come on, dudes, I need your help."
        - "Zingers have attacked Kong Island and kidnapped members of the Kong family. Go and rescue them. To pick up a passenger, land beside them and they will jump right in. Once they're on board, take them back to the helipad. You must rescue six hostages to complete this mission. She's all gassed up and ready to go. You have five minutes flying time."
        - "Well done. Take this Hero Coin as a small reward."
        - "Hey, man, I'm glad you're back. I need your help."
        - "I have dropped my ghetto blaster in the icy water below. Go and get it for me. Shoot the buttons hanging on the wall to lower the water. You only have three minutes of juice, so you better get going, dude!"
        - "Well done! I can now listen to the DK rap all night long."
        - "Here is your reward."
        - "Back again! Ready to hit the skies again?"
        - "The Kongs have been out exploring but have got themselves trapped. Go and rescue them. Raise and lower the water level using the buttons mounted on the walls. I didn't have time to fill her up. You only have three minutes flying time."
        - "Well done, guys. Take this as your reward."
        - "So, dude, think you're a pro pilot now, do you?"
        - "Rebuild the DK statue, but beware of entering the toxic waste. The Gyrocopter will explode with the slightest touch of that green filth. Use the buttons on the walls to lower the waste, then nip in and retrieve the statue parts."
        - "Nice flying! I thought you'd struggle with that mission. Here, take this."
        - "You guys sure know how to fly my old bird. Here, take this photo as a token of my appreciation."
        - "Hey, man! You have already completed this mission. I'm not paying you twice."
        - "You did get a new best time, though!"

    Donkey Kong Country: Rumble in the Jungle:
        - "Just surfing the wind currents, dudes. Nothing to get uptight about. Stay mellow, stay cool."
        - "That used to be the biggest city on Donkey Kong Island. It's called Big Ape City."
        - "I don't go looking for trouble, and most of the time it doesn't come looking for me."
